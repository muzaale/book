Hi everyone!

The teaching team looks forward to meeting you tomorrow. Whether we meet in-person or virtually, we believe the next five days are going to be an exciting and informative journey.

I invite you to casually review the following items in the class book https://jhustata.github.io/livre/intro.html before 8:30am:

   + Preface;
   + Session 1; and,
   + Quick References.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if anything remains unclear.

Abi
