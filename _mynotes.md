1. Over daily allowable amount
- Please clarify this because I'm charging this to my grant
- My budget includes justifications for networking or for a business account
- I paid for meals when I met some prospective collaborators in San Diego
- On some days I didn't pay for any meals because collaborators paid for me

2. Delta airlines has been slow at responding to my requests, however:
- They've been able to send me receipts for two of the charges ($11 and $180)
- A very odd technical error for the $220 charge is still being looked into
- For the above one the receipt I received was blank but its time-stamp matches my virtual card charge of $220
- I'll send you this confirmation from Delta as soon as they respond
- Will send an email with the explanation for the $180 and $220 (I topped up on the frequent flyer miles I had -- they were not sufficient)

3. Hotel Folio with all charges in one place
