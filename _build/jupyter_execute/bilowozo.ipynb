    "Based on the GTPCI Curriculum Retreat held in December at Mt. Washington, the GTPCI Program is introducing 4 pathways next year.  A summary of those 4 pathways is attached.\n",

    "As a reminder, all GTPCI students (independent of their chosen pathway) will be taking a set of Foundational Courses consisting of 51 credits (see attached handout page 4).\n",
    " \n",
    "MHS students will need to take an additional 19 credits that are pathway-specific to achieve a total of 70 credits to graduate.\n",

    "\n",
    "These additional credits will be coming from pathway-specific courses.  Some of these pathway-specific courses are required (for either MHS, PhD, or both) and some are electives.\n",
    " \n",
    "For all the courses listed, we are creating a master document that lists the term that each course is offered and the pre-requisites for that course (an example is listed in the Appendix of the attached document- it is still incomplete).\n",
    " \n",
    "Please look at the attached summary for each of the pathways (feel free to focus on the pathway that is relevant to you) and help us answer the following questions:\n",
    " \n",
    "Are the pathway competencies listed reasonable?  Did we miss any important competency for that pathway? [remember that there are general competencies for GTPCI that apply to students of all pathways; the competencies listed here are pathway-specific competencies].\n",
    "       \n",
    "Are the required pathway-specific courses (if any) for MHS and PhD students acceptable?  Do you think we should require any additional courses for either MHS or PhD (please specify if you think a course should be required for MHS, PhD, or both).\n",

    "Are the pathway-specific elective courses reasonable?  Did we miss an important class for that pathway?\n",

    "\n",
    "[If](https://muzaale.github.io/book/_downloads/29dbcbf95fe689a85a0882da2c0ce40c/wafa.chatGPT.png) you have an old Mac and want to install a specific version of ghp-import for pip3, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, make sure that you have pip3 installed. To do this, open a terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "which pip3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If pip3 is installed, this command will output the path to the pip3 executable. If it is not installed, you will need to install it before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have pip3 installed, you can install a specific version of ghp-import by specifying the version number when you run the pip3 install command. For example, if you want to install version 1.0.1 of ghp-import, you can run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```arduino\n",
    "pip3 install ghp-import==1.0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will install version 1.0.1 of ghp-import for pip3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After installing ghp-import, you should be able to use it by running the ghp-import command in your terminal. For example, to push a directory to the gh-pages branch of a GitHub repository, you can run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```arduino\n",
    "ghp-import -n <directory>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will push the contents of <directory> to the gh-pages branch of the repository and make them available at the repository's GitHub Pages URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",
