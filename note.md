001. hub

Only learned about GitHub it in my data science class by Caffo in the winter/spring of 2023. I'm now in the moving all my documents online. Not to be beholden of any local machine or the the software packages installed on it!

002. vscode

I may never use my iMac's terminal again! This is a sweet and beautiful medium between git & hub

003. local

Caffo's says Jupyter is ok for his [class](https://github.com/smart-stats/ds4bio_book): [zoom](https://jh.zoom.us/j/4109553504?pwd=amdidU82QTc2QTRmdkpDSkd3RU5pZz09) but that its not good for life since its python focused. His `qbook` runs on a [quarto](https://quarto.org) platform, which is multilingual like emacs and the right stuff for life. I'll stick to the shallow jupyter waters for now, thank you!

```
     jupyter-book create gitname
     git clone https://github.com/book
     cp -r gitname/* book
     cd book

     git rm old1.file old2.file old3..file
     git add ./*
     git commit -m "context"
     git push
     ghp-import -n -p -f _built/html
```

6. r(mean)

In this class: clarify the difference betweeen r() & c().
Say r(N) vs. c(N)
Return vs. current
One returns values after some command
While the other is just the current status
As such, a multivariable regression with missingness in its variables
May yield r(N) $\neq$ c(N)

8. hierarchy

```
     1. General Steps we can strive for as analysts (depending on your role in the project) 

     2. initial results to present to your co-lead or immediate mentor
	
     3. work iteratively with co-lead mentor to finalize the analysis/figures/tables (be writing methods now too)
	
     4. present to a higher mentor like Bill, Christine, the PI on the proposal (these are more polished slides with title slide, motivation, objectives, methods, and results)
	
     5. if approved, finalize the methods/results text in paper draft 
	
     6. start writing intro/discussion (if first author, its time to start on these), if not first, make sure first author has everything they need to write the rest of the paper (sometimes we write results as well- we are the most familiar with how our results should be interpreted, so i recommend writing the results)
	
     7. send to co-authors
	
     8. submit
```

9. macros

   [definition](https://www.stata.com/manuals/pmacro.pdf) & [more...](https://www.stata.com/manuals/gsub.pdf)

```
   local system macros

      1. name
      2. content
      3. c() 
      4. r()

   user-defined macros

      local, e.g. `m_iqr'

      global, e.g. ${workdir}
```

10. servers

```
     1. Need two more local servers
     2. Designing, running apps, websites
     3. Part of grant but unanticipaited needs
     4. Caffo class and multiple gitHub accounts proof!
```

11. % batch

      xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

      missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun


Based on the input provided, it appears that you are trying to use the git rm command to remove multiple files from a Git repository. The list of files you provided includes various image files (practice.png, generalpj2jpg.jpeg, dadlogo.png, dadlogo.jpg), notebook files (notebooks.ipynb, hub.ipynb), markdown files (markdown.md, markdown-notebooks.md), and a log file (log).

The error message xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun is related to the Command Line Tools for Xcode, which are required for some Git operations on macOS. It seems that the Command Line Tools are not properly installed or configured on your system.

To fix this issue, you can try reinstalling the Command Line Tools for Xcode using the following steps:

Open Terminal on your macOS system.
Run the following command: xcode-select --install. This will prompt you to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Once the installation is complete, try running your git rm command again.
If the issue persists, you may need to check your Xcode installation and make sure it is properly configured. You can also try resetting the developer path using the following command: sudo xcode-select --reset.

Note: You may need administrative privileges to install or configure the Command Line Tools for Xcode. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, it's recommended to consult the official documentation or seek help from a qualified macOS expert. Remember to always backup your important files before making any changes to your system. <|endoftext|>

problem solved!

12. push

The human race is frantically pushing its accumulated knowledge to the cloud (e.g., `git -> vscode -> hub`). Artificial intelligence, as it were, is frantically training on it!!
