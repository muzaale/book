001. hub

Only learned about GitHub it in my data science class by Caffo in the winter/spring of 2023. I'm now in the moving all my documents online. Not to be beholden of any local machine or the the software packages installed on it!

002. vscode

I may never use my iMac's terminal again! This is a sweet and beautiful medium between git & hub

003. local

Caffo's says Jupyter is ok for his [class](https://github.com/smart-stats/ds4bio_book): [zoom](https://jh.zoom.us/j/4109553504?pwd=amdidU82QTc2QTRmdkpDSkd3RU5pZz09) but that its not good for life since its python focused. His `qbook` runs on a [quarto](https://quarto.org) platform, which is multilingual like emacs and the right stuff for life. I'll stick to the shallow jupyter waters for now, thank you!
