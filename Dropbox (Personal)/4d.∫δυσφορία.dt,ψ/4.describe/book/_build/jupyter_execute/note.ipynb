    " \n",
    "We hope you are doing well!  Thanks for being part of the GTPCI Program.  We need your help.  This should take about 10 minutes of your time. Attached is a summary of the curriculum update that we are planning for AY 23-24.\n",
    "       \n",
    "Based on the GTPCI Curriculum Retreat held in December at Mt. Washington, the GTPCI Program is introducing 4 pathways next year.  A summary of those 4 pathways is attached.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a reminder, all GTPCI students (independent of their chosen pathway) will be taking a set of Foundational Courses consisting of 51 credits (see attached handout page 4).\n",
    " \n",
    "MHS students will need to take an additional 19 credits that are pathway-specific to achieve a total of 70 credits to graduate.\n",
    "       \n",
    "PhD students will need to take at least 14 credits in their 1st year and 5 additional courses in their 2nd/3rd years to graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additional credits will be coming from pathway-specific courses.  Some of these pathway-specific courses are required (for either MHS, PhD, or both) and some are electives.\n",
    " \n",
    "For all the courses listed, we are creating a master document that lists the term that each course is offered and the pre-requisites for that course (an example is listed in the Appendix of the attached document- it is still incomplete).\n",
    " \n",
    "Please look at the attached summary for each of the pathways (feel free to focus on the pathway that is relevant to you) and help us answer the following questions:\n",
    " \n",
    "Are the pathway competencies listed reasonable?  Did we miss any important competency for that pathway? [remember that there are general competencies for GTPCI that apply to students of all pathways; the competencies listed here are pathway-specific competencies].\n",
    "       \n",
    "Are the required pathway-specific courses (if any) for MHS and PhD students acceptable?  Do you think we should require any additional courses for either MHS or PhD (please specify if you think a course should be required for MHS, PhD, or both).\n",
    "       \n",
    "Are the pathway-specific elective courses reasonable?  Did we miss an important class for that pathway?\n",

    "1. **Lori lieberman:** Great songwriter, ok performer\n",
    "2. **Robert Flack:** Restructured Lori's [kadongo kamu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadongo_Kamu), opening with the F-minor chorus in a brief circle-of-fifths progression, which comes off as *a capella-like* given the subtle [Rhodes Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano) but prominent Roberta vocals, initially solo-like, but ~~gradually &~~ magically suffusing the air with delicate harmonies from 9ths to 15ths, as we are ushered into a word-less wailing session, where a 1970s-style bass is fixed on the E-Flat dominant, accompanied by drums that skip a beat as they do in reggae.\n",
    "3. **Lauren Hill:** Ancestral worship session. No worthy innovation or attempt at usurping Roberta!"
