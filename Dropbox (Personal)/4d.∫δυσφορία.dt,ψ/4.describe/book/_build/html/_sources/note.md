### 1. hub

Only learned about GitHub it in my data science class by Caffo in the winter/spring of 2023. I'm now in the moving all my documents online. Not to be beholden of any local machine or the the software packages installed on it!

### 2. vscode

I may never use my iMac's terminal again! This is a sweet and beautiful medium between git & hub

### 3. local

Caffo's says Jupyter is ok for his [class](https://github.com/smart-stats/ds4bio_book): [zoom](https://jh.zoom.us/j/4109553504?pwd=amdidU82QTc2QTRmdkpDSkd3RU5pZz09) but that its not good for life since its python focused. His `qbook` runs on a [quarto](https://quarto.org) platform, which is multilingual like emacs and the right stuff for life. I'll stick to the shallow jupyter waters for now, thank you!

     git clone https://github.com/book
     cp -r gitname/* book
     cd book

### 9. r(mean)

In this class: clarify the difference betweeen r() & c().
Say r(N) vs. c(N)
Return vs. current
One returns values after some command
While the other is just the current status
As such, a multivariable regression with missingness in its variables
May yield r(N) $\neq$ c(N)

### 10. hierarchy

```
     a) General Steps we can strive for as analysts (depending on your role in the project) 

     b) initial results to present to your co-lead or immediate mentor
    
     c) work iteratively with co-lead mentor to finalize the analysis/figures/tables (be writing methods now too)
    
     d) present to a higher mentor like Bill, Christine, the PI on the proposal (these are more polished slides with title slide, motivation, objectives, methods, and results)
    
     e) if approved, finalize the methods/results text in paper draft 
    
     f) start writing intro/discussion (if first author, its time to start on these), if not first, make sure first author has everything they need to write the rest of the paper (sometimes we write results as well- we are the most familiar with how our results should be interpreted, so i recommend writing the results)
    
     g) send to co-authors
    
     h) submit
```

### 11. macros

   [definition](https://www.stata.com/manuals/pmacro.pdf) & [more...](https://www.stata.com/manuals/gsub.pdf)

   user-defined macros

      local, e.g. `m_iqr'

      global, e.g. ${workdir}
      
```

### 12. servers

```
     1. Need two more local servers
     2. Designing, running apps, websites
     3. Part of grant but unanticipaited needs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun

Based on the input provided, it appears that you are trying to use the git rm command to remove multiple files from a Git repository. The list of files you provided includes various image files (practice.png, generalpj2jpg.jpeg, dadlogo.png, dadlogo.jpg), notebook files (notebooks.ipynb, hub.ipynb), markdown files (markdown.md, markdown-notebooks.md), and a log file (log).

The error message xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun is related to the Command Line Tools for Xcode, which are required for some Git operations on macOS. It seems that the Command Line Tools are not properly installed or configured on your system.

To fix this issue, you can try reinstalling the Command Line Tools for Xcode using the following steps:

Open Terminal on your macOS system.
Run the following command: xcode-select --install. This will prompt you to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Once the installation is complete, try running your git rm command again.
If the issue persists, you may need to check your Xcode installation and make sure it is properly configured. You can also try resetting the developer path using the following command: sudo xcode-select --reset.

Note: You may need administrative privileges to install or configure the Command Line Tools for Xcode. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, it's recommended to consult the official documentation or seek help from a qualified macOS expert. Remember to always backup your important files before making any changes to your system. <|endoftext|>

problem solved!

### 23. gtpci 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear GTPCI Friends and Family,
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope you are doing well!  Thanks for being part of the GTPCI Program.  We need your help.  This should take about 10 minutes of your time. Attached is a summary of the curriculum update that we are planning for AY 23-24.
       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the GTPCI Curriculum Retreat held in December at Mt. Washington, the GTPCI Program is introducing 4 pathways next year.  A summary of those 4 pathways is attached.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a reminder, all GTPCI students (independent of their chosen pathway) will be taking a set of Foundational Courses consisting of 51 credits (see attached handout page 4).
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHS students will need to take an additional 19 credits that are pathway-specific to achieve a total of 70 credits to graduate.
       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PhD students will need to take at least 14 credits in their 1st year and 5 additional courses in their 2nd/3rd years to graduate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These additional credits will be coming from pathway-specific courses.  Some of these pathway-specific courses are required (for either MHS, PhD, or both) and some are electives.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the courses listed, we are creating a master document that lists the term that each course is offered and the pre-requisites for that course (an example is listed in the Appendix of the attached document- it is still incomplete).
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please look at the attached summary for each of the pathways (feel free to focus on the pathway that is relevant to you) and help us answer the following questions:
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the pathway competencies listed reasonable?  Did we miss any important competency for that pathway? [remember that there are general competencies for GTPCI that apply to students of all pathways; the competencies listed here are pathway-specific competencies].
       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the required pathway-specific courses (if any) for MHS and PhD students acceptable?  Do you think we should require any additional courses for either MHS or PhD (please specify if you think a course should be required for MHS, PhD, or both).
       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the pathway-specific elective courses reasonable?  Did we miss an important class for that pathway?
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that we will experience some unanticipated obstacles when we introduce the pathways next year.  We will learn from them to ensure a smooth transition for the following year.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hanks so much!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what a [melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD0dy_1FsT0)!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initially got me thinking suspended 4th

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but later it occured to me that its [founded on the 9th](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/221bid/whats_the_difference_between_sus4_and_11th_chords/)!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the difference between sus4 and 11th chords?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sus4 chord implies no 3rd in the chord. So the notes in the chord are 1-4-5. The 11th chord implies a 3rd (and a 7th and a 9th), so the tones are 1-3-5-7-9-11.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 6 chord implies no extensions beyond the 6, so the notes are 1-3-5-6. The 13th chord implies the 7th, 9th, and 11th extensions, so the notes are 1-3-5-7-9-11-13.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the sus2 chord implies 1-2-5, whereas the 9th chord implies 1-3-5-7-9.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you play a C major triad on the piano and continue playing every other white key above the triad, you'll get the (major) 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th extensions

### 35. ds4ph.hw7

This will be my first assignment done in a purely git -> vscode -> hub workflow:

Return an ipython notebook and python dash app with the following:

0. Write a python function that takes an X and Y vector and returns an estimated $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ from linear regression. Check your function versus one of the prewritten ones. Include this in code cells of your ipython notebook.
1. Using Python and basic numpy functions, fit a linear regression model to the kirby 21 dataset into colab for the left telencelphalon (predictor) to the right telencephalon (outcome). Also, do the same reversing the predictor and response relationship. Do a scatterplot of the left telencephalon (type 1 level 1) volume by the right. Do not hold out any data (there's only 21 observations).
2. Consider a regression through the origin model  Y=BX . What would be the impact on the estimate of  B  if we replaced  X  by  cX  where  c  is a positive constant? Write your answer in a markdown cell of your ipython notebook.
3. Let  $X_i$  be a group indicator so that $x_i=I(i\in G_1)$ 
I.e. takes the value  1  when  $i$  is in group 1 and 0 if  i  is in group 0. Consider optimizing $\sum_i \frac{1}{n}(Y_i − \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i)^2$. 
If $\hat Y = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 X$, argue that $\hat Y$ is the group mean for group 1 if $X=1$ and the group mean for group 0 if $X=0$. You can either make a text argument in a markdown cell, or create a simulated example and show that the results holds. 
4. Argue that if you take the vectors $Y$ and $X$ and divide them by their standard deviations (respectively), the slope for either regressing $Y$ on $X$ or $X$ on $Y$ is simply the correlation. 
5. Consider the logistic curve 

$$
f(x) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x}}.
$$

Use streamlit to create a web page that shows the impact of changing $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. That is, it takes in two inputs, as sliders, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, and plots the resulting logistic curve.

what a perfect fit for 340.700!!!

python vs. r vs. stata

collaboration,publication,etc

Stata admit that they're behind in the game

What about SAS?

These platforms are open, thus the exponential growth of their communities

And contributors!!!

For this class: jupyter-book and bookdown will "challenge" the advanced students to explore and test the very limits of Stata :)

Each year will have access to the online books of the previous years

No reinventing the wheel!!!!

    a) articulate group task
    b) collaboration
    c) github
    d) publishing: jupyter-book, bookup
    e) where does stata stand?
    f) jupyter-book create & build 100% from terminal
    
### 41. tight-structure

background: turning point in the history of HCV Rx in 2013. AT $95k for curative dose, was clear to all insurance providers that this was cheaper than low cost, ineffective, drugs for life

methods: durand concurred that in her practice everyone eventually received treatment inspite of initial delays for SOME. So what would motivate a qualitative study when everything was pointing towards taking the new meds???

results: what is reported is plausible and consistent with what we've known from 2013-2023. so what exactly was the knowledge gap?

conclusion: and that is my question. maybe the background and intro should better align with anxiety about access to what is without a doubt a "miracle" cure!

acknowledgments: quantiative research? qualitative cannot keep on failing to acknowledge this!

references: providers, providers who themselves received an HCV organ, etc,

x

Made no mention of the HCV Rx

Hepatitis C infection is treated with antiviral medications intended to clear the virus from your body. The goal of treatment is to have no hepatitis C virus detected in your body at least 12 weeks after you complete treatment

persons: English-speaking patients
place: jhh
time: 2017-2021

Deep dive? Semi-structured interviews?
ZERO mention of the Rx????
Curative Rx arrived in 2013!!

Basically this study found that patients were motivated by the efficacy of HCV Rx
That they faced no alternative but death
